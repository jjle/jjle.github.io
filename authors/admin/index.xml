      <description>Hi! I am a geophysicist, born and raised in China and trained in Southern California. I am fascinated by the dynamic processes of the Earth and strive to understand their underlying physical mechanisms and predictability.
I am broadly interested in crustal dynamics and natural hazards, with current focuses on Earth&amp;rsquo;s deformation due to faulting or human activities over time scales spanning seconds to centuries. My approach to these problems blends observational, theoretical, and computational strengths through a combination of seismological/geodetic observational techniques and laboratory-based mechanical models.</description>
