Here we use Sentinel-1 satellite imagery for the Imperial Valley, California, over the period of 2015– 2019 to explore how factors specific to land surface changes may impact InSAR time series and to resolve time-varying deformation due to tectonic processes and geothermal energy production. We examine the temporal variability of data quality, via interferometric phase coherence, at high spatial resolution, taking into account the observation that some agricultural fields lie fallow for long time intervals punctuated by periods of cultivation. This strategy allows us to better distinguish signals and noise associated with agricultural activities, shoreline changes, or surface soil conditions. A series of masking, interpolation, and filtering steps facilitate phase unwrapping, and the unwrapped, unfiltered product is then recovered, reducing artifacts from spatial filtering. We adopt model-based tropospheric corrections to improve time series results, particularly in regions with high topographic relief, along with the use of distributed reference points to render a more uniform error structure. We validate InSAR observations with continuous GPS where available and find that the estimates of average line-of-sight (LOS) velocity over the valley from InSAR and GPS agree to ~ 3 mm/yr in areas with good data coverage. Discrepancies between the two estimates often exist in areas with lower InSAR data quality; in better-constrained areas, they appear to reveal signals attributable to surficial processes occurring in the uppermost soil layers. We observe a diverse suite of natural signals over multiple spatial scales, including steady interseismic deformation, seasonal lake-level-modulated signals at the southeastern Salton Sea shore, and transient slow slip on the Superstition Hills fault. In addition, we observe complex deformation at four geothermal fields within the valley. Extensive subsidence at the Salton Sea geothermal field suggests spatial overlap of anthropogenic and tectonic deformation, interspersed with potential surficial signals. Geothermal sites at East Mesa, North Brawley, and Heber exhibit smaller-amplitude, more localized deformation, often with nonlinear temporal trends. Our analysis demonstrates the need to assess whether InSAR signals result from surficial changes or deeper sources, and produces robust ground deformation data in support of efforts to study subsurface processes, manage geothermal operations, and improve hazard assessments.","tags":["Anthropogenic activity","Fault creep","Geodetic imaging","Geothermal operation","GPS","Ground deformation","InSAR","Lake level change","Land use","Regional tectonics","Soil moisture","Tropospheric noise","Uncertainty quantification"],"title":"Coherence-Guided InSAR Deformation Analysis in the Presence of Ongoing Land Surface Changes in the Imperial Valley, California","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brittany A.

However, significant challenges in SEAS modeling remain in resolving multiscale interactions between earthquake nucleation, dynamic rupture, and aseismic slip, and understanding physical factors controlling observables such as seismicity and ground deformation. The increasing complexity of SEAS modeling calls for extensive efforts to verify codes and advance these simulations with rigor, reproducibility, and broadened impact. In 2018, we initiated a community code-verification exercise for SEAS simulations, supported by the Southern California Earthquake Center. Here, we report the findings from our first two benchmark problems (BP1 and BP2), designed to verify different computational methods in solving a mathematically well-defined, basic faulting problem. We consider a 2D antiplane problem, with a 1D planar vertical strike-slip fault obeying rate-and-state friction, embedded in a 2D homogeneous, linear elastic half-space. Sequences of quasi-dynamic earthquakes with periodic occurrences (BP1) or bimodal sizes (BP2) and their interactions with aseismic slip are simulated. The comparison of results from 11 groups using different numerical methods show excellent agreements in long-term and coseismic fault behavior. In BP1, we found that truncated domain boundaries influence interseismic stressing, earthquake recurrence, and coseismic rupture, and that model agreement is only achieved with sufficiently large domain sizes. In BP2, we found that complexity of fault behavior depends on how well physical length scales related to spontaneous nucleation and rupture propagation are resolved. Poor numerical resolution can result in artificial complexity, impacting simulation results that are of potential interest for characterizing seismic hazard such as earthquake size distributions, moment release, and recurrence times. These results inform the development of more advanced SEAS models, contributing to our further understanding of earthquake system dynamics.","tags":null,"title":"The Community Code Verification Exercise for Simulating Sequences of Earthquakes and Aseismic Slip (SEAS)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ekaterina Tymofyeyeva","Yuri Fialko","**Junle Jiang**","Xiaohua Xu","David Sandwell","Roger Bilham","Thomas K.

Considering all significant ruptures that occurred in the region, it has been suggested that the cumulative moment generated co-seismically along this part of the subduction over the last century exceeds the moment deficit accumulated inter-seismically since 1906. Such an excess challenges simple models with earthquakes resetting the elastic strain accumulated inter-seismically in locked asperities. These inferences are however associated with large uncertainties that are generally unknown. The impact of spatial smoothing constraints on co-seismic and inter-seismic models also prevents any robust assessment of the strain budget. We propose a Bayesian kinematic slip model of the 2016 Pedernales earthquake using the most comprehensive dataset to date including InSAR and GPS offsets, tsunami waveforms, and kinematic records from high-rate GPS and strong-motions. In addition, we use inter-seismic geodetic velocities to produce a probabilistic inter-seismic coupling model of the subduction interface. Our stochastic co-seismic and inter-seismic solutions include the ensemble of all plausible models consistent with our prior information and that fit the observations within uncertainties. The analysis of these model ensembles indicates that an excess of co-seismic moment during the 1906–2016 period is likely in Central Ecuador only if we assume that 1942 and 2016 earthquakes are colocated. If this assumption is relaxed, we show that this conclusion no longer holds given uncertainties in co- and inter-seismic processes. The comparison of 1942 and 2016 teleseismic records reveals large uncertainties in the location of the 1942 event, hampering our ability to draw strong conclusions on the unbalanced moment budget in the region. Our results also show a heterogeneous coupling of the subduction interface that coincides with two slip asperities in our co-seismic model for the 2016 Pedernales earthquake and with the location of historical ruptures in 1958, 1979 and 1998. The spatial variability in coupling and complexity in earthquake history suggest strong heterogeneities in frictional properties of the subduction megathrust.","tags":["bayesian inversion","Ecuador–Colombia subduction zone","geodetic coupling model","kinematic source model","strain budget"],"title":"Strain Budget of the Ecuador–Colombia Subduction Zone: A Stochastic View","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaohua Xu","Lauren A Ward","**Junle Jiang**","Bridget Smith-Konter","Ekaterina Tymofyeyeva","Eric O Lindsey","Arthur G Sylvester","David T Sandwell"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"103e2a14aab98188cb165bd46927051c","permalink":"https://jjle.github.io/publication/xu-2018-a/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xu-2018-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract A major challenge for understanding the physics of shallow fault creep has been to observe and model the long-term effect of stress changes on creep rate.

The main result of this analysis is that the average surface creep rate increased after the Landers event and then decreased by a factor of 2?7 over the past few decades. We consider quasi-static and dynamic Coulomb stress changes on the SSAF due to these three major events. From our analysis, the elevated creep rates after the Landers can only be explained by static stress changes, indicating that even in the presence of dynamically triggered creep, static stress changes may have a long-lasting effect on SSAF creep rates.","tags":["coulomb stress change","shallow fault creep","temporal change","time scale‐dependent complexity"],"title":"Surface Creep Rate of the Southern San Andreas Fault Modulated by Stress Perturbations from Nearby Large Events","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Junle Jiang**","Nadia Lapusta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"4f943f9d0bbaee7e64e52c5e9c6deeab","permalink":"https://jjle.github.io/publication/jiang-2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jiang-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Thickness of the seismogenic zone is commonly determined based on the depth of microseismicity or the fault locking depth inferred from geodetic observations. The relation between the two estimates and their connection to the depth limit of large earthquakes remain elusive. Here we explore the seismic and geodetic observables in models of faults governed by laboratory-based friction laws that combine quasi-static rate-and-state friction and enhanced dynamic weakening. Our models suggest that the transition between the locked and fully creeping regions can occur over a broad depth range. The effective locking depth, D elock , associated with concentrated loading and promoting microseismicity, is located at the top of this transition zone; the geodetic locking depth, D glock , inverted from surface geodetic observations, corresponds to the depth of fault creeping with approximately half of the long-term rate. Following large earthquakes, D elock either stays unchanged or becomes shallower due to creep penetrating into the shallower locked areas, whereas D glock deepens as the slip deficit region expands, compensating for the afterslip. As the result, the two locking depths diverge in the late interseismic period, consistent with available seismic and geodetic observations from several major fault segments in Southern California. We find that D glock provides a bound on the depth limit of large earthquakes in our models. However, the assumed layered distribution of fault friction and simple depth estimates are insufficient to characterize more heterogeneous faults, e.g., ones with significant along-strike variations. Improved observations and models are needed to illuminate physical properties and seismic potential of fault zones.","tags":["dynamic weakening","fault mechanics","geodetic locking","large earthquakes","microseismicity","rate-and-state friction"],"title":"Connecting Depth Limits of Interseismic Locking, Microseismicity, and Large Earthquakes in Models of Long-Term Fault Slip","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Han Yue","Mark Simons","Zacharie Duputel","**Junle Jiang**","Eric Fielding","Cunren Liang","Susan Owen","Angelyn Moore","Bryan Riel","Jean Paul Ampuero","Sergey V Samsonov"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"eb145d5309ae05177257d92a407d324b","permalink":"https://jjle.github.io/publication/yue-2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yue-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"On April 25th 2015, the Mw 7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake ruptured a portion of the Main Himalayan Thrust underlying Kathmandu and surrounding regions. We develop kinematic slip models of the Gorkha earthquake using both a regularized multi-time-window (MTW) approach and an unsmoothed Bayesian formulation, constrained by static and high rate GPS observations, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offset images, interferometric SAR (InSAR), and teleseismic body wave records. These models indicate that Kathmandu is located near the updip limit of fault slip and approximately 20km south of the centroid of fault slip. Fault slip propagated unilaterally along-strike in an ESE direction for approximately 140km with a 60km cross-strike extent. The deeper portions of the fault are characterized by a larger ratio of high frequency (0.03–0.2Hz) to low frequency slip than the shallower portions. From both the MTW and Bayesian results, we can resolve depth variations in slip characteristics, with higher slip roughness, higher rupture velocity, longer rise time and higher complexity of subfault source time functions in the deeper extents of the rupture. The depth varying nature of rupture characteristics suggests that the up-dip portions are characterized by relatively continuous rupture, while the down-dip portions may be better characterized by a cascaded rupture. The rupture behavior and the tectonic setting indicate that the earthquake may have ruptured both fully seismically locked and a deeper transitional portions of the collision interface, analogous to what has been seen in major subduction zone earthquakes.","tags":["Bayesian inversion","Gorkha earthquake","Joint inversion","Kinematic rupture process inversion"],"title":"Depth Varying Rupture Properties during the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) Earthquake","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sylvain Michel","Jean-Philippe Avouac","Nadia Lapusta","**Junle Jiang**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"372aa26d9afa294f1abc4b27829bba0f","permalink":"https://jjle.github.io/publication/michel-2017/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/michel-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Megathrust earthquakes tend to be confined to fault areas locked in the interseismic period and often rupture them only partially.

The lower edge of the rupture produced dominant high-frequency ($$1 Hz) radiation of seismic waves. We show that similar partial ruptures occur spontaneously in a simple dynamic model of earthquake sequences. The fault is governed by standard laboratory-based rate-and-state friction with the aging law and contains one homogenous velocity-weakening (VW) region embedded in a velocity-strengthening (VS) area. Our simulations incorporate inertial wave-mediated effects during seismic ruptures (they are thus fully dynamic) and account for all phases of the seismic cycle in a self-consistent way. Earthquakes nucleate at the edge of the VW area and partial ruptures tend to stay confined within this zone of higher prestress, producing pulse-like ruptures that propagate along strike. The amplitude of the high-frequency sources is enhanced in the zone of higher, heterogeneous stress at the edge of the VW area.","tags":["Gorkha earthquake","High Frequency Radiation","Main Himalayan Thrust","Megathrusts","Partial Ruptures","Pulse"],"title":"Pulse-like Partial Ruptures and High-Frequency Radiation at Creeping-Locked Transition during Megathrust Earthquakes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenyuan Fan","Dan Bassett","**Junle Jiang**","Peter M Shearer","Chen Ji"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"dc4af2a26c04af234f71ccd543faf33d","permalink":"https://jjle.github.io/publication/fan-2017-a/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fan-2017-a/","section":"publication","summary":"The 2006 Mw 7.8 Java earthquake was a tsunami earthquake, exhibiting frequency-dependent seismic radiation along strike.

Despite considerable efforts to analyze this event, the different available observations have proven difficult to reconcile in a single finite-fault slip model. In particular, the critical near-field geodetic records contain variable and significant postseismic signal (between 2 weeks' and 2 months' worth), while the satellite altimetry records of the associated tsunami are affected by various sources of uncertainties (e.g., source rupture velocity and mesoscale oceanic currents). In this study, we investigate the quasi-static slip distribution of the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake by carefully accounting for the different sources of uncertainties in the joint inversion of available geodetic and tsunami data. To this end, we use nondiagonal covariance matrices reflecting both observational and modeling uncertainties in a fully Bayesian inversion framework. Modeling errors can be particularly large for great earthquakes. Here we consider a layered spherical Earth for the static displacement field, nonhydrostatic equations for the tsunami, and a 3-D megathrust interface geometry to alleviate some of the potential epistemic uncertainties. The Bayesian framework then enables us to derive families of possible models compatible with the unevenly distributed and sometimes ambiguous measurements. We infer two regions of high fault slip at 3°N?4°N and 7°N?8°N with amplitudes that likely reach values as large as 40 m and possibly larger. These values are a factor of 2 larger than typically found in previous studies?potentially an outcome of commonly assumed forms of regularization. Finally, we find that fault rupture very likely involved shallow slip. Within the resolution provided by the existing data, we cannot rule out the possibility that fault rupture reached the trench.","tags":["Bayesian","earthquake","inverse theory","slip model","Sumatra-Andaman","tsunami"],"title":"A Bayesian Source Model for the 2004 Great Sumatra-Andaman Earthquake","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Junle Jiang**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"e623db3d3f6d15ab7d6a0295a0c25ee0","permalink":"https://jjle.github.io/publication/jiang-2016-a/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jiang-2016-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Probabilistic Imaging and Dynamic Modeling of Earthquake Source Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Junle Jiang**","Mark Simons"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"2b26670ffad2b83ce1586fbac16b8c83","permalink":"https://jjle.github.io/publication/jiang-2016-b/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jiang-2016-b/","section":"publication","summary":"Diverse observations from the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake pointed to large coseismic fault slip proximal to the Japan Trench. This seismic failure prompted a reevaluation of the conventional view that the outer fore-arc is generally aseismic. However, the nature of near-trench fault slip during this event remains debated, without consensus on whether slip peaked at the trench or at greater depths. Here we develop a probabilistic approach to image the spatiotemporal evolution of coseismic seafloor displacement from near-field tsunami observations. In a Bayesian framework, we sample ensembles of nonlinear models parameterized to focus on near-trench features, incorporating the uncertainty in modeling dispersive tsunami waves in addition to nominal observational errors. Our models indicate that seafloor in the region of the earthquake was broadly uplifted and tilted seaward approaching the deep-ocean trench. Over length scales of 40 km, seafloor uplift peaks at 5 $pm$ 0.6 m near the inner-outer fore-arc transition and decreases to 2 m at the trench axis over a distance of 50 km, corresponding to a seafloor tilt of 0.06 $pm$ 0.02 m/km. Over length scales of 20 km, peak uplift reaches 7 $pm$ 2 m at the similar location, but uplift at the trench is less constrained. Elastic modeling that reproduces the observed tilt requires a coseismic slip deficit at the trench. Such a deficit is effectively consistent with a metastable frictional model for the shallowest megathrust. While large shallow earthquakes in the region cannot be completely ruled out, aseismic deformation is the most likely mode for satisfying the long-term slip budget.","tags":["Bayesian inversion","seafloor deformation","subduction zone megathrust","Tohoku-oki earthquake","tsunami","uncertainty characterization"],"title":"Probabilistic Imaging of Tsunamigenic Seafloor Deformation during the 2011 Tohoku-Oki Earthquake","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Junle Jiang**","Yuri Fialko"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"fefec0073038153444182266c7e52a0c","permalink":"https://jjle.github.io/publication/jiang-2016-c/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jiang-2016-c/","section":"publication","summary":"Observations from the Anza section of the San Jacinto Fault in Southern California reveal that microseismicity extends to depths of 15?18?km, while the geodetically determined locking depth is less than 10?km.

We suggest that an anomalously shallow geodetic fault locking may result from a transition zone at the bottom of seismogenic layer with spatially heterogeneous frictional properties. Numerical models of faults that incorporate stochastic heterogeneity at transitional depths successfully reproduce the observed depth relation between seismicity and geodetic locking, as well as complex spatiotemporal patterns of microseismicity with relatively scarce repeating earthquakes.

Combining 1 Hz kinematic GPS, static GPS offsets, seafloor geodesy and near-field and far-field tsunami data into a massively parallel Monte Carlo simulation, we construct an ensemble of samples of the posterior probability density function describing the evolution of fault rupture. We find that most of the slip is concentrated in a depth range of 10--20 km from the trench, and that slip decreases towards the trench with significant displacements at the toe of wedge occurring in just a small region.

Significant challenges in SEAS modeling remain in resolving multiscale interactions between aseismic fault slip, earthquake nucleation, and dynamic rupture; and understanding physical factors controlling observables such as seismicity and ground deformation. The increasing capability and complexity of SEAS modeling calls for extensive efforts to verify and advance these simulations with rigor, reproducibility, and broadened impact. Over the past year, we have initiated a community code-verification exercise for SEAS simulations, supported by SCEC (the Southern California Earthquake Center). Through this exercise, we aim to develop best practices, and code-verification and simulation tools for SEAS modeling that would benefit a larger community.\nWe have completed our first two benchmarks, designed to test the capabilities of different computational methods in correctly solving a mathematically well-defined, basic problem in crustal faulting. These benchmarks are based on a 2D antiplane problem, with a 1D planar vertical strike-slip fault obeying rate-and-state friction, embedded in a 2D homogeneous, linear elastic half-space. The fault has a shallow seismogenic region with velocity-weakening friction and a deeper velocity-strengthening region, below which a relative plate motion rate is imposed. A periodic sequence of spontaneous, quasi-dynamic earthquakes and slow slip are simulated in the model. We have established an online platform for modelers to upload and compare simulation results. The comparison of ~20 models from 11 groups using different numerical methods (FDM/FEM/BEM) show excellent general agreements. We found that domain truncation and boundary conditions strongly influence interseismic fault stressing, earthquake recurrence, and coseismic rupture speed, and that agreement between models is only achieved with sufficiently large domain sizes. Building on this initial success, we are working toward more complex scenarios involving variable event sizes, a dipping fault, and a 3D problem in our upcoming benchmarks.\nOnline benchmark platform http://scecdata.usc.edu/cvws/seas/\nOur SCEC Workshop in April, 2018 https://www.scec.org/workshops/2018/cvws-seas\nOur SCEC Workshop in November, 2018 https://www.scec.org/workshops/2018/seas\nOur presentations at 2018 SCEC/AGU Jiang, J., \u0026amp; Erickson, B.

Many studies have taken advantage of the very dense Japanese onland strong motion, broadband, and continuous GPS networks in this sense. But resolution tests and the variability in the proposed solutions have highlighted the difficulty to uniquely resolve the slip distribution from these networks, relatively distant from the source region, and with limited azimuthal coverage. In this context, we present a finite fault slip joint inversion including an extended amount of complementary data (teleseismic, strong motion, high-rate GPS, static GPS, seafloor geodesy, and tsunami records) in an attempt to reconcile them into a single better resolved model. The inversion reveals a patchy slip distribution with large slip (up to 64 m) mostly located updip of the hypocenter and near the trench. We observe that most slip is imaged in a region where almost no earthquake was recorded before the main shock and around which intense interplate seismicity is observed afterward. At a smaller scale, the largest slip pattern is imaged just updip of an important normal fault coseismically activated. This normal fault has been shown to be the mark of very low dynamic friction allowing extremely large slip to propagate up to the free surface. The spatial relationship between this normal fault and our slip distribution strengthens its key role in the rupture process of the Tohoku-Oki earthquake.","tags":null,"title":"A Detailed Source Model for the Mw9.0 Tohoku-Oki Earthquake Reconciling Geodesy, Seismology, and Tsunami Records","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shengji Wei","Robert Graves","Don Helmberger","Jean-Philippe Avouac","**Junle Jiang**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"767db1f567b186d50522ead05c317a21","permalink":"https://jjle.github.io/publication/wei-2012/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wei-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"Modeling strong ground motions from great subduction zone earthquakes is one of the great challenges of computational seismology.

Estimates of total fault slip and surface secular strain accumulation on millennial time scales suggest the need to consider the potential for a future large earthquake just south of this event.","tags":null,"title":"The 2011 Magnitude 9.0 Tohoku-Oki Earthquake: Mosaicking the Megathrust from Seconds to Centuries","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
