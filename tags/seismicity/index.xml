      <title>Surface Change, Ground Deformation, and Seismicity</title>

      <description>We study surface changes, ground deformation, and seismicity in various settings. We primarily use remote-sensing techniques, e.g., multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and GPS, and other auxiliary datasets to characterize robust ground deformation history in regions under the influences of tectonics (e.g., fault-zone deformation), surficial processes (e.g., soil moisture), and/or anthropogenic activities (e.g., agriculture and energy production).
Our focus is on the connections between surface observations and subsurface processes, including the existence or absence of seismicity.</description>

      <description>My interests under this broad topic include dynamic earthquake ruptures, interactions between seismic and aseismic processes, observations from geodesy, seismology, and geology, laboratory-based constitutive laws.</description>

      <description>Extracting important and relevant physics from data and developing models with predictive power will be a significant task in the future of Earth sciences. Many of my observation-oriented projects share the theme of utilizing a Bayesian probabilistic inference framework (analytical and numerical sampling approaches) with an emphasis on uncertainty quantification of observations and physical modeling, along with its impact on our predictions.
The second, complementary part of my research involves developing cross-scale computational models with detailed physics and predictive powers to understand earthquakes, tsunamis, or slow slip.</description>
