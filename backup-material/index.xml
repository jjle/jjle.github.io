      <title>Subduction Zone and Tsunami Processes</title>

      <description>I am interested in understanding earthquake and tsunami hazards in major subduction zones around the world, e.g., East Japan, Nankai Trough, Chile, Peru, Cascadia, Alaska, Sumatra, New Zealand, etc. One of the significant questions I hope to address is the tsunamigenic processes of shallow megathrust and outer wedge of the forearc, and the associated tsunami propagation and coastal inundation processes. I am also interested in the rheology and heterogeneity of deeper megathrusts and their implications for seismic behavior and coastal shaking.</description>

      <title>Integration of Seismic-Geodetic Observations</title>

      <description>I am particularly interested in exploring the wide spetrum of dynamic Earth processes by intergrating seismological and geodetic observations. These efforts include imaging space-time patterns of fault slip during and after earthquakes (strong motion, GPS, tide gauges, and tsunami waveforms), inferring frequency-dependent signals during the potential activation of splay faulting (seismic records and tsunami waveforms), and, more recently, imaging the continuous transition from earthquake arrest to postseismic fault slip (strong motion records, high-rate GPS, and daily GPS).</description>

      <title>Community Modeling Initiative - SEAS</title>

      <description>Numerical simulations of Sequences of Earthquakes and Aseismic Slip (SEAS) have made great progress over the past decades to address important questions in earthquake physics and fault mechanics. Significant challenges in SEAS modeling remain in resolving multiscale interactions between aseismic fault slip, earthquake nucleation, and dynamic rupture; and understanding physical factors controlling observables such as seismicity and ground deformation. The increasing capability and complexity of SEAS modeling calls for extensive efforts to verify and advance these simulations with rigor, reproducibility, and broadened impact.</description>
