 abstract = {Why many major strike-slip faults known to have had large
earthquakes are silent in the interseismic period is a
long-standing enigma. One would expect small earthquakes to
occur at least at the bottom of the seismogenic zone, where
deeper aseismic deformation concentrates loading. We suggest
that the absence of such concentrated microseismicity
indicates deep rupture past the seismogenic zone in previous
large earthquakes. We support this conclusion with numerical
simulations of fault behavior and observations of recent major
events. Our modeling implies that the 1857 Fort Tejon
earthquake on the San Andreas Fault in Southern California
penetrated below the seismogenic zone by at least 3 to 5
kilometers. Our findings suggest that such deeper ruptures may
occur on other major fault segments, potentially increasing
the associated seismic hazard.},
