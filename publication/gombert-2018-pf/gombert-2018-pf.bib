 abstract = {The 2016 Pedernales earthquake (MW=7.8) ruptured a portion of the
Colombia--Ecuador subduction interface where several large
historical earthquakes have been documented since the great 1906
earthquake (M=8.6). Considering all significant ruptures that
occurred in the region, it has been suggested that the cumulative
moment generated co-seismically along this part of the subduction
over the last century exceeds the moment deficit accumulated
inter-seismically since 1906. Such an excess challenges simple
models with earthquakes resetting the elastic strain accumulated
inter-seismically in locked asperities. These inferences are
however associated with large uncertainties that are generally
unknown. The impact of spatial smoothing constraints on
co-seismic and inter-seismic models also prevents any robust
assessment of the strain budget. We propose a Bayesian kinematic
slip model of the 2016 Pedernales earthquake using the most
comprehensive dataset to date including InSAR and GPS offsets,
tsunami waveforms, and kinematic records from high-rate GPS and
strong-motions. In addition, we use inter-seismic geodetic
velocities to produce a probabilistic inter-seismic coupling
model of the subduction interface. Our stochastic co-seismic and
inter-seismic solutions include the ensemble of all plausible
models consistent with our prior information and that fit the
observations within uncertainties. The analysis of these model
ensembles indicates that an excess of co-seismic moment during
the 1906--2016 period is likely in Central Ecuador only if we
assume that 1942 and 2016 earthquakes are colocated. If this
assumption is relaxed, we show that this conclusion no longer
holds given uncertainties in co- and inter-seismic processes. The
comparison of 1942 and 2016 teleseismic records reveals large
uncertainties in the location of the 1942 event, hampering our
ability to draw strong conclusions on the unbalanced moment
budget in the region. Our results also show a heterogeneous
coupling of the subduction interface that coincides with two slip
asperities in our co-seismic model for the 2016 Pedernales
earthquake and with the location of historical ruptures in 1958,
1979 and 1998. The spatial variability in coupling and complexity
in earthquake history suggest strong heterogeneities in
frictional properties of the subduction megathrust.},
