 abstract = {We present a fully Bayesian inversion of kinematic rupture
parameters for the 2011 Mw9 Tohoku-oki, Japan earthquake. Albeit
computationally expensive, this approach to kinematic source
modelling has the advantage of producing an ensemble of slip
models that are consistent with physical a priori constraints,
realistic data uncertainties, and realistic but simplistic
uncertainties in the physics of the kinematic forward model, all
without being biased by non-physical regularization constraints.
Combining 1 Hz kinematic GPS, static GPS offsets, seafloor
geodesy and near-field and far-field tsunami data into a
massively parallel Monte Carlo simulation, we construct an
ensemble of samples of the posterior probability density
function describing the evolution of fault rupture. We find that
most of the slip is concentrated in a depth range of 10--20 km
from the trench, and that slip decreases towards the trench with
significant displacements at the toe of wedge occurring in just
a small region. Estimates of static stress drop and rupture
velocity are ambiguous. Due to the spatial compactness of the
fault rupture, the duration of the entire rupture was less than
approximately 150 s.},
