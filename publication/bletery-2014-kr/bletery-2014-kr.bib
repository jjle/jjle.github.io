 abstract = {The 11 March 2011 Mw9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake was recorded by an
exceptionally large amount of diverse data offering a unique
opportunity to investigate the details of this major megathrust
rupture. Many studies have taken advantage of the very dense
Japanese onland strong motion, broadband, and continuous GPS
networks in this sense. But resolution tests and the variability
in the proposed solutions have highlighted the difficulty to
uniquely resolve the slip distribution from these networks,
relatively distant from the source region, and with limited
azimuthal coverage. In this context, we present a finite fault
slip joint inversion including an extended amount of
complementary data (teleseismic, strong motion, high-rate GPS,
static GPS, seafloor geodesy, and tsunami records) in an attempt
to reconcile them into a single better resolved model. The
inversion reveals a patchy slip distribution with large slip (up
to 64 m) mostly located updip of the hypocenter and near the
trench. We observe that most slip is imaged in a region where
almost no earthquake was recorded before the main shock and
around which intense interplate seismicity is observed afterward.
At a smaller scale, the largest slip pattern is imaged just updip
of an important normal fault coseismically activated. This normal
fault has been shown to be the mark of very low dynamic friction
allowing extremely large slip to propagate up to the free
surface. The spatial relationship between this normal fault and
our slip distribution strengthens its key role in the rupture
process of the Tohoku-Oki earthquake.},
