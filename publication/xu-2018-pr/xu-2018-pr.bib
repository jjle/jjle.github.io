 abstract = {Abstract A major challenge for understanding the physics of
shallow fault creep has been to observe and model the long-term
effect of stress changes on creep rate. Here we investigate the
surface creep along the southern San Andreas fault (SSAF) using
data from interferometric synthetic aperture radar spanning over
25 years (ERS 1992?1999, ENVISAT 2003?2010, and Sentinel-1
2014?present). The main result of this analysis is that the
average surface creep rate increased after the Landers event and
then decreased by a factor of 2?7 over the past few decades. We
consider quasi-static and dynamic Coulomb stress changes on the
SSAF due to these three major events. From our analysis, the
elevated creep rates after the Landers can only be explained by
static stress changes, indicating that even in the presence of
dynamically triggered creep, static stress changes may have a
long-lasting effect on SSAF creep rates.},
