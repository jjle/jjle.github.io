 abstract = {The 2004 Mw 9.1?9.3 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake is one of the
largest earthquakes of the modern instrumental era. Despite
considerable efforts to analyze this event, the different
available observations have proven difficult to reconcile in a
single finite-fault slip model. In particular, the critical
near-field geodetic records contain variable and significant
postseismic signal (between 2 weeks' and 2 months' worth), while
the satellite altimetry records of the associated tsunami are
affected by various sources of uncertainties (e.g., source
rupture velocity and mesoscale oceanic currents). In this study,
we investigate the quasi-static slip distribution of the
Sumatra-Andaman earthquake by carefully accounting for the
different sources of uncertainties in the joint inversion of
available geodetic and tsunami data. To this end, we use
nondiagonal covariance matrices reflecting both observational and
modeling uncertainties in a fully Bayesian inversion framework.
Modeling errors can be particularly large for great earthquakes.
Here we consider a layered spherical Earth for the static
displacement field, nonhydrostatic equations for the tsunami, and
a 3-D megathrust interface geometry to alleviate some of the
potential epistemic uncertainties. The Bayesian framework then
enables us to derive families of possible models compatible with
the unevenly distributed and sometimes ambiguous measurements. We
infer two regions of high fault slip at 3째N?4째N and 7째N?8째N with
amplitudes that likely reach values as large as 40 m and possibly
larger. These values are a factor of 2 larger than typically
found in previous studies?potentially an outcome of commonly
assumed forms of regularization. Finally, we find that fault
rupture very likely involved shallow slip. Within the resolution
provided by the existing data, we cannot rule out the possibility
that fault rupture reached the trench.},
