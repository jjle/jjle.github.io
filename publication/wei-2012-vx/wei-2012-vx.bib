 abstract = {Modeling strong ground motions from great subduction zone
earthquakes is one of the great challenges of computational
seismology. To separate the rupture characteristics from
complexities caused by 3D sub-surface geology requires an
extraordinary data set such as provided by the recent Mw9.0
Tohoku-Oki earthquake. Here we combine deterministic inversion
and dynamically guided forward simulation methods to model over
one thousand high-rate GPS and strong motion observations from 0
to 0.25Hz across the entire Honshu Island. Our results display
distinct styles of rupture with a deeper generic interplate event
(∼Mw8.5) transitioning to a shallow tsunamigenic earthquake
(∼Mw9.0) at about 25km depth in a process driven by a strong
dynamic weakening mechanism, possibly thermal pressurization.
This source model predicts many important features of the broad
set of seismic, geodetic and seafloor observations providing a
major advance in our understanding of such great natural hazards.},
