 abstract = {Abstract Observations of shallow fault creep reveal increasingly complex time-dependent slip histories that include quasi-steady creep and triggered as well as spontaneous accelerated slip events. Here we report a recent slow slip event on the southern San Andreas fault (SSAF) triggered by the 2017 Mw8.2 Chiapas (Mexico) earthquake that occurred 3000 km away. Geodetic and geologic observations indicate that surface slip on the order of 10 mm occurred on a 40-km-long section of the SSAF between the Mecca Hills and Bombay Beach, starting minutes after the Chiapas earthquake and continuing for more than a year. Both the magnitude and the depth extent of creep vary along strike. We derive a high-resolution map of surface displacements by combining Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) acquisitions from different lines of sight. InSAR-derived displacements are in good agreement with the creepmeter data and field mapping of surface offsets. Inversions of surface displacement data using dislocation models indicate that the highest amplitudes of surface slip are associated with shallow ($<$1 km) transient slip. We performed 2-D simulations of shallow creep on a strike-slip fault obeying rate-and-state friction to constrain frictional properties of the top few kilometers of the upper crust that can produce the observed behavior.},
