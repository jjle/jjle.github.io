9.0 Tohoku-Oki, Japan earthquake allow exploration of a rare
large event along a subduction megathrust. Models for this
event indicate that the distribution of coseismic fault slip
exceeded 50 meters in places. Sources of high-frequency
seismic waves delineate the edges of the deepest portions of
coseismic slip and do not simply correlate with the locations
of peak slip. Relative to the M(w) 8.8 2010 Maule, Chile
earthquake, the Tohoku-Oki earthquake was deficient in
high-frequency seismic radiation--a difference that we
attribute to its relatively shallow depth. Estimates of total
fault slip and surface secular strain accumulation on
millennial time scales suggest the need to consider the
potential for a future large earthquake just south of this
event.},
