 abstract = {Thickness of the seismogenic zone is commonly determined based on
the depth of microseismicity or the fault locking depth inferred
from geodetic observations. The relation between the two
estimates and their connection to the depth limit of large
earthquakes remain elusive. Here we explore the seismic and
geodetic observables in models of faults governed by
laboratory-based friction laws that combine quasi-static
rate-and-state friction and enhanced dynamic weakening. Our
models suggest that the transition between the locked and fully
creeping regions can occur over a broad depth range. The
effective locking depth, D elock , associated with concentrated
loading and promoting microseismicity, is located at the top of
this transition zone; the geodetic locking depth, D glock ,
inverted from surface geodetic observations, corresponds to the
depth of fault creeping with approximately half of the long-term
rate. Following large earthquakes, D elock either stays unchanged
or becomes shallower due to creep penetrating into the shallower
locked areas, whereas D glock deepens as the slip deficit region
expands, compensating for the afterslip. As the result, the two
locking depths diverge in the late interseismic period,
consistent with available seismic and geodetic observations from
several major fault segments in Southern California. We find that
D glock provides a bound on the depth limit of large earthquakes
in our models. However, the assumed layered distribution of fault
friction and simple depth estimates are insufficient to
characterize more heterogeneous faults, e.g., ones with
significant along-strike variations. Improved observations and
models are needed to illuminate physical properties and seismic
potential of fault zones.},
